## 📋 Test Strategy

### Testing Approach
Our testing strategy follows a multi-layered approach covering:

1. **Functional Testing**: Core game mechanics and user interactions
2. **UI/UX Testing**: Interface elements and user experience flows
3. **Performance Testing**: Responsiveness and memory management
4. **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance and usability
5. **Edge Case Testing**: Error handling and boundary conditions

  - Invalid key rejection
  - Mixed controls and uppercase keys
  - Pause state control handling
  - Key combinations and modifier keys
  - Continuous key holding

#### 💥 Collision Detection (`collision-detection.spec.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Verifies game boundary and collision mechanics
- **Coverage**:
  - Wall collision detection (all 4 walls)
  - Game over modal functionality
  - Score preservation on collision
  - Reset functionality post-collision
  - Edge case boundary detection

#### 🍎 Food and Scoring (`food-scoring.spec.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Tests scoring mechanics and food consumption
- **Coverage**:
  - Score increment validation (+10 per food)
  - High score tracking and persistence
  - Final score display accuracy
  - Score reset functionality
  - Rapid scoring handling

#### ⚡ Performance and Edge Cases (`performance-edge-cases.spec.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Stress testing and error handling
- **Coverage**:
  - Rapid button clicking stress tests
  - Extended gameplay performance
  - Window resize responsiveness
  - Memory leak prevention across sessions
  - Extremely rapid input handling
  - State consistency after errors
  - Page refresh during gameplay recovery
  - Simultaneous key press handling
  - Focus changes during gameplay

#### ♿ Accessibility and UX (`accessibility.spec.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Ensures inclusive design and WCAG compliance
- **Coverage**:
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Screen reader compatibility structure
  - Button states and labels
  - Visual feedback for game states
  - Score display clarity
  - Instructions accessibility
  - Game over modal accessibility
  - Reduced motion preference handling
  - Mobile viewport responsiveness
  - Color contrast validation
  - User action feedback
  - Focus management
  - Semantic HTML structure

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Page Object Model (POM)
The `SnakeGamePage` class encapsulates all game interactions:
- Locator definitions for all UI elements
- Helper methods for complex game actions
- State validation methods
- Performance monitoring capabilities

### Test Utilities
- **GameTestUtils**: Performance monitoring, retry logic, random input generation
- **TestConstants**: Centralized test data, timeouts, and game configuration
- **Cross-browser testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile Chrome

### Configuration Highlights
- **Multi-browser support**: Tests run across different browsers
- **Parallel execution**: Tests run concurrently for speed
- **Rich reporting**: HTML, JSON, and JUnit reports generated
- **Automatic screenshots**: Captured on test failures
- **Video recording**: Available for failed tests
- **Trace collection**: Detailed debugging information

## 🎯 Key Testing Scenarios

### Creative Test Cases Implemented

1. **Rapid Input Stress Testing**: Validates game stability under extreme user input
2. **Memory Leak Detection**: Multiple game sessions to test resource management
3. **Focus Management**: Ensures proper keyboard navigation flow
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Tests across different viewport sizes
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks response times and identifies bottlenecks
6. **State Consistency Testing**: Verifies game recovers from error conditions
7. **Simultaneous Input Handling**: Tests overlapping key press scenarios

### Edge Cases Covered

- Invalid keyboard inputs (filtered appropriately)
- Simultaneous key presses
- Rapid state changes
- Window resizing during gameplay
- Page refresh during active game
- Reduced motion preferences
- Mixed control schemes (arrows + WASD)
- Modifier key combinations

- **User Flows**: Complete game lifecycle covered
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive edge case testing
- **Performance**: Stress testing and optimization validation

## 🔍 Interesting Findings
- Found bug on **collision-detection.spec.ts** for test `should reset button work after collision`. Game over modal is not hidden when user press Reset button
- On **movement-controls.spec.ts** for test `should ignore invalid keys during gameplay` is flaky. Sometimes fail
- On **performance-edge-cases.spec.ts** for test `should handle extremely rapid input without crashes` is flaky due to random movement. Often hitting the wall before timeout makes the test fail since the assertion is checking whether game still on or not.
- On **food-scoring.spec.ts** for test `should increment score when food is consumed` is flaky due to the snake find food using random movement. I don't know how to find food using color contrast or other method yet.

## Notes
I have checked the test one by one. Other than tests I mentioned on Interesting Finding, the tests are passed. However, as I run the whole test several times, some of the test will sometimes fail. Due to the time limit, I unable to debug them.

## 📝 Contributing

To extend this test suite:

1. Follow the existing Page Object Model pattern
2. Add new test utilities to `GameTestUtils.ts`
3. Update constants in `TestConstants.ts`
4. Maintain consistent naming conventions
5. Include both positive and negative test cases
6. Add appropriate timeouts and wait strategies
